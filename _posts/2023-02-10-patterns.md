A Rust tip for newcomers.

If you're learning Rust, you probably know about the `match` expression. It allows you to do stuff
like take an `Option<T>` apart:

```rust
fn example(x: Option<i32>) {
  match x {
    Some(x) => println!("{x}"),
    None => println!("Nothing!"),
  }
}
```

Reading [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html), you probably
also learned a thing about defining your own enums, which you can also `match` on:

```rust
struct LinearRgb { r: f32, g: f32, b: f32 }
struct LinearRgba { r: f32, g: f32, b: f32, a: f32 }

enum AnyColor {
  LinearRgb(LinearRgb),
  LinearRgba(LinearRgba),
}

impl AnyColor {
  fn to_linear_rgba(self) -> LinearRgba {
    match self {
      AnyColor::LinearRgb(rgb) => LinearRgba { r: rgb.r, g: rgb.g, b: rgb.b, a: 1.0 },
      AnyColor::LinearRgba(rgba) => rgba,
    }
  }
}
```

Now, I'll admit it: I haven't read the entire Rust book. It demonstrates patterns and where
they can be used in [chapter 18](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-01-all-the-places-for-patterns.html) (!),
but I bailed out long before I got to that point. What fun is there in reading a book about a shiny
new language and not trying out that shiny new language after all?

If you're like me, then this post is for you. A hopefully nice, dense, and terse explanation of
pattern matching.

Brace yourself, because we're in for a real ride.

## But what are patterns, exactly?

Patterns are at the core of pattern matching, so it's important that we define what they actually
are. But before we get to that, let's start with something everybody learns at the beginning of
their programming career: *literals.*

Literals are the bread and butter of inputting data into a program. If you've never heard of them
being referred to that way - the name comes from them being *literal values* that you put into the
program's source code, such as `1`:

```rust
let an_int = 1; // that's a literal!
```

The simplest types of literals are those for representing primitive data types such as `bool` or
integers, but we also have literals for compound data types such as structs.

```rust
struct Vector {
  x: f32,
  y: f32,
}

struct Player {
  position: Vector,
}

let player = Player {
  position: Vector {
    x: 32.0,
    y: 32.0,
  },
};
```

What's common among all types of literals is that they are used for *making new values*. And you
may be like, *duh* of course they do! Weren't you supposed to be talking about patterns?

The reason why I'm bringing up literals is because **patterns are the exact opposite thing.**
Instead of *making* values, they *break* them apart into pieces.

Consider that `AnyColor::to_linear_rgba` function from before:

```rust
enum AnyColor {
  LinearRgb(LinearRgb),
  LinearRgba(LinearRgba),
}

impl AnyColor {
  fn to_linear_rgba(self) -> LinearRgba {
    match self {
      AnyColor::LinearRgb(rgb) => LinearRgba { r: rgb.r, g: rgb.g, b: rgb.b, a: 1.0 },
      AnyColor::LinearRgba(rgba) => rgba,
    }
  }
}
```

Recall that the left-hand side of `=>` in a `match` is the pattern we're matching against.
Remember how you can construct an enum?

```rust
let color = AnyColor::LinearRgb(rgb);
```

Now compare the two:

```rust
let color = AnyColor::LinearRgb(rgb);
            AnyColor::LinearRgb(rgb) => LinearRgba { r: rgb.r, g: rgb.g, b: rgb.b, a: 1.0 },
```

It's a *match*! <sub>(pun intended.)</sub>

Patterns mostly use the same syntax as literals, so any time you want to break a value apart to
pieces, you can just write a matching literal, replacing exact values that you don't want to match
exactly with identifiers, and in 99% of cases it'll work!

```rust
// Let's say we have a tuple:
let tuple = (1, 2, 3);

// We want to do something special with the second
// and third number if the first number is 1.
match tuple {
  // Note how I replaced the values I want to take out
  // from the tuple with identifiers.
  (1, x, y) => println!("x + y = {}", x + y),
  _ => (),
}
```

## They're more advanced than you think they are

But recall also that `Vector` and `Player` example from before. Did you notice that the literals
nest? â€“ the `Player {}` literal nests a `Vector {}` literal inside of itself.

And the best news is that **patterns can do that too.**

```rust
enum Entity {
  Player(Player),
  Enemy(Enemy),
}

let entity = /* ... */;

match entity {
  // Look at that! A pattern matching a struct inside a struct inside an enum.
  Entity::Player(Player {
    position: Vector { x, y },
  }) => {
    println!("Got a player at x = {x}, y = {y}"),
  },
  _ => (),
}
```

But wait, there's more! Sometimes you get a big struct and you're not interested in 80% of its
contents. You could just ignore its fields one by one by matching them against `_`...

```rust
match some_struct {
  SomeStruct {
    name: "bye_egg",
    // Just like in struct literals, we can omit the value after `:`, but this time instead of
    // creating the field from an existing variable it'll create a new variable with the same name
    // as the field - exactly the opposite to what literals do!
    value,
    some: _,
    uninteresting: _,
    stuff: _,
  } => /* ... */,
  _ => (),
}
```

...or you could just use `..` to ignore them all.

```rust
match some_struct {
  SomeStruct {
    name: "bye_egg",
    value,
    ..
  } => /* ... */,
  _ => (),
}
```

Pretty neat, isn't it?

And this works with more than just structs. Tuples also let you do that:

```rust
match (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) {
  (first, ..) => /* ... */,

  // It can even go in the middle!
  // But you can only have one, otherwise
  // how would it know how many elements to discard?
  (first, .., last) => /* ... */,

  // And of course it can go at the end, too.
  (.., second_to_last, last) => /* ... */,
}
```

Speaking of tuples, notice how I used a tuple literal after `match` here? You can match on multiple
values using that.

```rust
match (instruction, a, b) {
  (Instruction::Add, x, y) => x + y,
  (Instruction::Double, x, _) => x * 2,
}
```

## There are two types of patterns

Recall that Rust forces you to handle every possible case in a `match` expression. For example,
this will not work:

```rust
match x {
  1 => println!("One!"),
}
```

but if we add a catch-all `_` *wildcard* pattern at the end, it will:

```rust
match x {
  1 => println!("One!"),
  _ => (),
}
```

There are certain cases though where we do not need such a catch-all, such as:

```rust
match () {
  () => println!("in this example!"),
}
```

The property we're observing here is called *refutability*. A pattern is *irrefutable* when it
matches against all values of a given type. We could also use the definition that a pattern is
irrefutable if the compiler doesn't complain when we throw it into a `match` with a single arm, like
in the case above.

Certain patterns are always refutable. For example, a primitive literal like `1` is
refutable, since there are other literals of the same type that would not match `1`.

Other patterns are always irrefutable. For example, the wildcard pattern `_` is always irrefutable,
since it matches against any value and ignores it. The identifier pattern `abc` is also always
irrefutable, because it matches against any value and assigns it to a new variable `abc`.

However, there are also compound patterns such as tuples and structs, and since they can contain
other patterns inside of them, they're only irrefutable if all their contained patterns are also
irrefutable. For example the pattern `(a, b)` is irrefutable since it matches any tuple, but the
pattern `(1, b)` is not, since it would fail to match any tuple whose first field is not `1`.

## They're everywhere

And that leads me to the most mind-blowing part of this post, which is also the title:
**patterns are everywhere.** `match` is hardly the only language construct that uses patterns.
Recall `if let`:

```rust
if let Some(x) = example {
  println!("Got a value! {x}");
}
```

The left hand side of `=` is a(n irrefutable) pattern!

But there are also others, like `while let`:

```rust
// Iterate through an iterator, manually.
while let Some(x) = iterator.next() {
  println!("{x}");
}
```

...or `let`:

```rust
let (x, y) = thing;
println!("got {x}, {y}");
```

...or `for`:

```rust
for (key, value) in hash_map.iter() {
  println!("{key}: {value}");
}
```

...or parameters:

```rust
fn length_squared((x, y): (f32, f32)) -> f32 {
  x * x + y * y
}
```

...or parameters, again:

```rust
let sum: usize = list.iter()
  // That's a reference pattern! It matches a reference.
  .map(|&x| x * 2)
  .sum();
```

But the even more mind-blowing part is that each of these use cases is syntax sugar for a `match`.

Take `if let`:

```rust
if let Some(x) = example {
  println!("Got a value! {x}");
}
// same as:
match example {
  Some(x) => println!("Got a value! {x}"),
  _ => (),
}
```

Or `while let`:

```rust
while let Some(x) = iterator.next() {
  println!("{x}");
}
// same as:
loop {
  match iterator.next() {
    Some(x) => println!("{x}"),
    _ => break,
  }
}
```

Or hell, even `let`:

```rust
let (x, y) = thing;
// same as:
match thing {
  (x, y) => {
    println!("got {x}, {y}");
  }
  // Hey look, `let` patterns must be exhaustive!
  // There is no catch-all branch in this `match`.
}
```

`for` is sugar for a `while let` with an implicit iterator variable, so it's all patterns and
`match` under the hood too:

```rust
for (key, value) in hash_map.iter() {
  println!("{key}: {value}");
}
// same as:
let mut _iterator = hash_map.iter().into_iter(); // NOTE: this variable is hidden from you.
while let Some((key, value)) = _iterator.next() {
  println!("{key}: {value}");
}
// same as:
let mut _iterator = hash_map.iter().into_iter();
loop {
  match _iterator.next() {
    Some((key, value)) => println!("{key}: {value}"),
    _ => break,
  }
}
```

And parameters are just `let` bindings for incoming arguments. Unfortunately there's no way for us
to desugar those, other than maybe `match`ing on incoming arguments, but that's the same as `let`
anyways.

## Conclusion

I hope this post helped you see the power of patterns. Sometimes they let you write a lot less code
than you would otherwise have to, and I really miss them while coding C++ at my day job.

So make use of them! Spread the knowledge, and share this post with people who may be struggling to
see that *all is patterns, and patterns are everywhere.*
