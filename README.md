# liquidev's blog

This repository houses the source code to my blog, as well as the posts hosted there.

## License

I don't want people just ripping code or words off my blog posts, thus all posts here are licensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.
This means if you use parts of these posts in your own works, you must also license your work under the same license. The work must also be non-commercial, and you must explicitly state somewhere that I'm the original author.

However I allow one exception to this. You are free to use my posts as long as you're only quoting what I wrote, without the NonCommercial and ShareAlike restrictions. Thus, if you use parts of my posts and explicitly state that you're quoting this blog, you must only credit me in your work.

I am not explicitly licensing the HTML and SCSS source code, mainly because I don't want people using my design for their own blog. Please come up with something yourself, or use one of the community-built themes. You are allowed to look at the code and send in bug fixes via PRs, but please do not use this repository as a base for your own blog. Thanks!
