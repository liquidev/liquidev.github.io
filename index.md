# Sup.

I'm liquidev, and welcome to my website and blog.

I'm a hobbyist programmer from Poland who likes thinking critically and solving cool problems in his spare time. I code various things, ranging from utility libraries and CLI programs, to video games, desktop applications, and even programming languages themselves.

I also take insterest in UI and UX design, and value elegance, reliability, and user-friendliness, over filling my software with useless features that few people use.
